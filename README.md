# Redlife- A blood bank management system

Redlife is a web-based application that enables blood donors and blood banks to register and log in to the system. The platform allows donors to use the Google Maps API and open-source geocoding API to locate nearby blood banks. On the other hand, blood banks can update their blood availability, which donors can view based on their location.

The website is built using node.js, express.js, and express handlebars as the templating engine. MySQL is used as the database management system to store and manage data efficiently. The front-end design is user-friendly and responsive, allowing donors and blood bank staff to navigate the website easily.

Donors can create an account, update their information, and view nearby blood banks on a map. They can also make appointments to donate blood and check the availability of blood products in the blood banks. The blood banks, after registration, can update their inventory, and the system sends alerts to the staff when the inventory level is low.
